# Uber Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project exploring travel patterns, trends, and insights using Uber trip data. The analysis aims to identify key metrics, correlations, and actionable recommendations based on trip frequency, purpose, duration, and destinations.

## üìä **Project Overview**

The analysis dives into the dataset to uncover travel patterns, focusing on:
- Frequency of trips by purpose.
- Correlation between trip distance and duration.
- Identification of top routes based on average miles.
- Exploration of the most popular start and stop locations.
- Monthly trends in total trips and miles traveled.
- Seasonal variations in trip purposes and destinations.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Steps Taken for Analysis**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Converted date columns into datetime format.
   - Calculated trip duration and extracted the month for time-based analysis.
   - Handled missing and invalid data entries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generated descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical data.
   - Visualized data using bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, and heatmaps.
   - Examined correlations, trends, and outliers.

3. **Time-Based Analysis**:
   - Grouped data by months and explored patterns in trip frequency and miles traveled.
   - Analyzed the most popular destinations and trip purposes across different months.

4. **Geographic Insights**:
   - Identified top start and stop locations.
   - Mapped travel routes for long-distance trips.

5. **Result Interpretation and Recommendations**:
   - Provided actionable recommendations based on findings.
   - Highlighted key trends and anomalies for business and operational insights.

## üìà **Key Results**

The results are documented in detail in the attached [Travel Analysis Report (PDF)](Reports/Travel_Analysis_Report.pdf). Key findings include:

- **Meeting Dominance**: Meetings were the most common purpose for trips, accounting for a significant proportion of travel.
- **Distance and Duration Correlation**: Longer trips correlated strongly with longer durations, following an approximately linear trend.
- **Top Routes**: Routes exceeding 150 miles were dominated by long-distance travel, while shorter routes clustered regionally.
- **Seasonal Trends**: November and April showed peaks in total trips and miles, respectively, suggesting seasonal travel preferences.
- **Purpose Trends**: Meetings were consistently the top purpose, with emerging customer visits and site-related travel trends.
- **Popular Destinations**: Cary, Fort Pierce, and Berkeley ranked among the top destinations, with notable seasonal fluctuations.

## üí° **Insights and Recommendations**

1. Optimize meeting schedules by leveraging virtual formats to reduce travel.
2. Map regional hubs for targeted transportation improvements.
3. Explore time-based and seasonal travel patterns for resource planning.
4. Invest in geographic analysis and time series forecasting for future trip predictions.
